# Exile-Territory-Radius-Marker-Fix

This fixes the problem with stuck territory radius marker arrows.
Now every player of a territory can delete the radius markers without any problem.

# Installation
- 1 - Make a CfgExileCustomCode override for ExileClient_gui_xm8_slide_territory_event_onRadiusButtonClick.sqf
- 2 - Done
